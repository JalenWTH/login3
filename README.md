The third iteration of my authorization practice projects. This one features cleaner class-based views instead of function-based views and Django's LoginRequiredMixin.

## How to run it:

This text assumes you already have Python and the pip package manager installed on your device

This app only requires Django and Python

### Django installation

From your command line, change directories to the directory of your Python installation, and run the pip installation:

`pip install django==4.0.4`

To view your Django version and make sure the installation worked, run:

`django-admin --version`
